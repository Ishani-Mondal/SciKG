Our results outperform  other participants in terms of F&M, but fails to ob- tain a similar performance in terms of F score. Note  that the average of the column rank is 2,25 indicat- ing that if only these metrics where considered our  position remains the same. Indeed, in the evaluation  many others factor were evaluated such as: Cyclic- ity, Categorisation (i.i.), Connectivity (c.c.) and do- mains. Our results are also good in all them where  we obtain first or second best performance, except  for Categorisation (i.i.) where we are the least per- forming team. Indeed, this can be explained by our  choice of these objective functions that are driven  by the partial knowledge. Due to the cost required  to generate this partial knowledge, the manual anno- tators tend to relate one concept to many concepts  which force some flatness in our taxonomy. How- ever, the I structure objective criteria tends to force  the acquisition of a hierarchical structure. In future  experiments we plan to include additional objectives  to avoid this situation.  In terms of manual evaluation, we obtain good re- sults only for the Science (Eurovoc) dataset where  our algorithm get the best performance. One expla- nation is the random selection of only hundred rela- tionships to evaluate. Note that this sample is small  compared with the actual number of terms in each  dataset. However, only one of the participants man- age to get good results in the manual evaluation. For  the Science dataset, the ordered results of all partic- ipants are: 0.71, 0.14, 0.09, 0.07 and 0.06. Note  that our performance, 0.07, is not very far from 3th  and 5th position, but clearly far form the first one.  This situation is quite similar for the Enviromment  (Eurovoc) dataset, where the missing values of Ta- ble 2 are 0.02, 0.08 and 0.11. Note that, again, the  best performance is clearly far from the other partic- ipants.

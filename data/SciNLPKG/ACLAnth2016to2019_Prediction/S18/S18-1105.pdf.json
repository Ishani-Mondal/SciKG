In Task A, on  the official CodaLab ranking, we ranked in the  16 th position with the unconstrained version of  our submission. When comparing our official re- sult with the one obtained by the best-ranked sys- tem (0.7054), it can be noticed that the difference  is lower than 0.1 in F-score terms. It is an in- teresting result considering that our system relies  mainly on features covering different facets of af- fect in ironic tweets, and confirms the key role  that such kind of affective information plays for  detecting irony in Twitter. In addition, the or- ganizers also provided separate rankings for con- strained and unconstrained submissions. Our sys- tem ranked in the 17 th position in the constrained  setting, while in the unconstrained one we ranked  as 4 th . Moreover, the performance of our system  seems to be stable in the two C and U settings.  Concerning Task B, our system performed rela- tively well, considering that we did not apply fur- ther tuning to capture different ironic devices.

content they read by providing information nutrition labels for online news articles.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In analogy to groceries , where nutrition labels help consumers make choices that they consider best for themselves , information nutrition labels tag online news articles with data that help readers judge the articles they engage with.", "labels": [], "entities": []},

content is immense and its sources are very diverse.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For the readers and other consumers of online news who value balanced, diverse and reliable information, it is necessary to have access to methods of evaluating the news articles available to them.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This is somewhat similar to food consumption where consumers are presented with a huge variety of alternatives and therefore face the challenge of deciding what is good for their health.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This is why food packages come with nutrition labels that guide the consumers in their decision making.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Taking this analogy, Fuhr and colleagues (2018) discuss the idea of implementing information nutrition labels for news articles.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "They propose to label every online news article with information nutrition labels that describe the ingredients of the article and give readers a chance to make an informed judgment about what they are reading.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The authors discuss nine different information nutrition labels: factuality, readability, virality, emotion/sentiment, opinion/subjectivity/objectivity, controversy, authority/credibility/trust, technicality and topicality.", "labels": [],

this work we actually implement information nutrition labels and deliver them as a browser plugin that we call NewsScan.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Therefore we provide a basis for evaluating how well labels describe the online news content and for investigating how useful they are to real users for making decisions about whether to read the news and whether to trust its content.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "To avoid biasing the user in anyway with respect to the consumption of an article, the information is solely presented but not interpreted.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Judgments about news sources should be made by users themselves.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Whether an article will be read or discarded depends on the user's own weighing of importance of the information nutrition labels.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The plugin supports the reader in these tasks through easy-to-understand visualizations of the labels.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In this paper we discuss the methods behind the label computation (Section 2) and the design of the user interface (Section 3).", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "datasetContent": [{"text": "To evaluate NewsScan in terms of wording, coloring and usability, we will conduct qualitative user studies.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Participants will be interviewed and asked about their perception of the tool in general as well as concerning specific features.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Since our aim is to not bias the user towards a consumption of one news article or another, we need to evaluate the plugin regarding that.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Especially the wording of the features could affect the user in forming an opinion about an article.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, we want to help our users making an informed decision, so we need some kind of guiding, hence wording.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "To ensure that our tool only works as a guide and not a specific recommender, we do not interpret, for example, an easy-to-read article as being not worthwhile reading but just easy to understand.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, we believe some threshold label values about worthwhile and not worthwhile articles would indeed help readers in their decision making.", "labels": [], "entities": [{"text": "decision making", "start_pos": 128, "end_pos": 143, "type": "TASK",

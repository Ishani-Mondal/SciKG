size and the distribution of word lengths.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We show that these factors can substantially affect the statistics of a phono-logical network and propose anew method for making more robust comparisons.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We then analyse eight languages, finding many commonalities but also some qualitative differences in their lexicon

similarity to other words in the mental lexicon (often operationalised as neighbourhood density, i.e., the number of words that differ from a target word by just a single phoneme)).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Yet the nature of these effects is not always consistent between languages.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For example, in English, the neighbourhood density of a word was found to correlate positively with reaction times in a picture naming task), and negatively with the speed and accuracy of participants' responses in a lexical decision task).", "labels":

might result from differences in the global lexicon structure: for example, if one language exhibits much greater similarity between words overall, this could affect how language processing mechanisms develop, leading to qualitatively different behaviour.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "One way to analyse the global phonological structure of the mental lexicon is by representing it as a phonological network: a graph in which nodes correspond to the wordforms in a lexicon, and edges link nodes which are phonologically similar according to some metric (typically, words which differ by exactly one phoneme, i.e. they have a Levenshtein distance of one).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The structure of the network can then be analysed quantitatively using measures from network science.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "While neighbourhood density (i.e., a node's degree) is one local measure of connectivity, other measures can better capture the global structure of the network.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "By comparing these measures across languages, we might find explanations for the behavioural differences mentioned above.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "As well as providing insight into cross-linguistic variations in language processing, cross-linguistic comparisons of phonological network structure could also uncover universal properties of language or typological generalisations.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Indeed, argued based on an analysis of phonological networks from five languages that these networks share several structural properties that distinguish them from other naturally occurring networks, suggesting some important underlying organisation.", "labels": [], "entities":

learning processes).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, work by found that several of the structural properties discussed above were also found in a random pseudolexicon with the same word lengths as areal English lexicon, but with the phonemes in each word chosen at random.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus, they argued that these structural properties are simply a by-product of the way phonological networks are defined (by connecting similar strings) and should not betaken as evidence of particular growth processes (or presumably, any other cognitive pressures Arbesman et al. might later have had in mind).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "These studies highlight some important methodological issues that need to be resolved if we hope to use network analysis as a tool for cross-linguistic studies.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In order to make meaningful comparisons between different languages' networks, we need to determine what constitutes a large or small difference in phonological network statistics by comparing all languages to appropriate random baselines.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In addition, there are two other factors that have not been explicitly considered in previous studies of phonological networks.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "First, we don't know how the size of a phonological network (number of nodes) affects its statistics.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The lexicons in Arbesman et al.'s study ranged from 2500 words (Hawaiian) to 122,000 words (Spanish), yet if the size of the Spanish lexicon had also been 2500 words, it might have yielded quite different statistics.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Second, there is alack of consensus about whether phonological networks should be constructed from lemmas or from all wordforms including morphological variants, and in some cases, datasets may only be available for one or the other option.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Therefore, we need to understand how including or excluding inflectional variants affects the measured statistics of phonological networks.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In this paper, we investigate the questions above, synthesizing arguments from the literature with our own analyses to propose anew method for comparing phonological networks across languages.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Using this method, we compare network statistics across eight different languages to appropriate baselines at a range of lexicon sizes.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We show that findings for English extend to the other seven languages we consider, supporting their argument that the small-world properties of phonological networks should not be used as evidence of particular cognitive/growth processes.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We also find that network statistics vary with lexicon size within each language, but not always in the same way.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "These differences provide a first step in investigating the relationship between cross-linguistic variation in language processing and global lexicon structure.", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "datasetContent": [], "tableCaptions": [{"text": " Table 1: Sources and sizes of

expressions (MWEs) and idioms in particular () exhibit an idiosyncratic behavior that makes their account troublesome for most grammar models, including restricted semantic compositionality and

prefabricated patterns ties in well with the basic tenets of constructionist approaches, that view the lexicon and the grammar as a network of form-meaning correspondences spanning from abstract and

undergo.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It has indeed been traditionally argued that while replacing the constituents of a literal combination like to watch a movie with synonymous or semantically related words (e.g. to watch a film) does not result in a significant change in meaning, modifying an idiomatic string like to spill the beans into something like to spill the peas entails the loss of the figurative interpretation.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Actually, psycholinguistic studies investigating the comprehension of idiom lexical variants have found such alternative forms to be more acceptable when the idiom parts independently contribute to the idiomatic meaning (e.g. burst the ice from break the ice) than when they don't (e.g. boot the bucket from kick the bucket) ( or when the idioms are more familiar to the speakers (.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Nonetheless, this kind of lexical flexibility does not turnout to be so

of the restricted formal variability exhibited by idioms to devise indices that automatically separate them from more literal combinations.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Some of them have

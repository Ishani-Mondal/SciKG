the model is presented, and the system is evaluated in a user study, where the adaptive robot presenter is compared to a non-adaptive version.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The adaptive

modalities, and continuously adapt its behaviour to accommodate the listener.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It is also not obvious that such a system would be better in terms of teaching the presented material and user experience, compared to a fixed, non-adaptive presentation (such as audio-guides used in museums), as the robot is unlikely to exhibit the same level of adaptation as a human.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This paper has two main contributions, which address these concerns.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "First, we explore the use of Behaviour

action ladder.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The non-adaptive system also never yielded the turn to the user.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The nonadaptive mode presented the

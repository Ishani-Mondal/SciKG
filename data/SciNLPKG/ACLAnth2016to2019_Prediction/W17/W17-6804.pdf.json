meaning has mostly been studied in the abstract, as lists of possible word senses.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In contrast, other neighbouring fields such as sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics have emphasised the link between semantic variation and the activities and interactions of speakers.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The distinction between the two approaches is relevant: while the former is based on the idea that, fora given word, a finite list of discrete senses is available, the latter builds on a more dynamic concept, namely that anew meaning can emerge in any interaction among speakers, who use it in order to make communication more effective.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Understanding the intricate ways in which patterns of word use and communities of individuals are related is essential for characterising the interests and the expressive means of sub-cultures, as well as to develop NLP tools that are

different online communities.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We take online communities, such as online discussion forums, to be excellent examples of communities of practice, that is, aggregates of individuals not defined by a location or a population, but rather by social engagement in some common endeavour.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Using computational modelling techniques and statistical analyses, we show that community-specific conventional meanings of common word forms (as opposed to jargon) do arise and can be reliably detected, which is consistent with

several Reddit sub-communities engaged in discussing two broad domains, Football and Programming.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We evaluate our framework extrinsically against a language modelling task, showing that the semantic shifts we detect on common words are strong enough to affect performance.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Our results show that distinct meaning conventions arise within communities engaged in discussing a shared domain, but also that the domain itself is not the only determinant of semantic variation: subcommunities concerned with discussing the same general topic may also develop their own conventional meanings for common words, which supports the view that the main factors driving semantic variation are local accommodation effects presumably arising during interaction.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In addition, our findings indicate that, besides frequency-related factors, the level of dissemination of a word among community members plays a key role in understanding the dynamics of meaning variants.", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "datasetContent": [{"text": "Online communities offer an unprecedented

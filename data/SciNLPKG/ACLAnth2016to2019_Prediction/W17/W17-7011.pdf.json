It is then possible to perform queries on the annotated corpus, searching for all the occurrences of one hashtag or the co-occurrences of two or more hashtags . Once the tragic corpus had been annotated, it became clear that restructuring the tags in the tagset into an ontology would make the annotated corpus even more useful and allow more complex and expressive queries to be made against the text.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We will discuss the design of this ontology in section 3, while in the next section we will look in more detail at the original tagset itself.", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "datasetContent": [], "tableCaptions": []}

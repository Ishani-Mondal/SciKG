conversational robots have to be capable of both linguistic interaction with humans and interaction with their environment through perception and action if we want them apart of our daily lives.",

language will be preferred.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Secondly, by being part of the human environment containing everyday objects such as tables and chairs, robots too have to have knowledge how humans structure and organise their world which is again reflected inhuman language.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Connecting language with perception and action is commonly known as grounding).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The main challenge in grounding is that we are connecting two representation systems, (i) a perceptual which is commonly captured in physical sciences as continuous realvalued features and (ii) a symbolic conceptual system that makes up human language.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "There is no one-to-one correspondence between the two: linguistic descriptions such as \"close to the table\" and \"red\" correspond to some function predicting the degree of acceptability over physical or colour space.", "labels": [],

layers.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It follows that several descriptions maybe equally applicable for the same situation: the chair can be \"close to the table\" or \"to the left of the table\" which means vagueness is prevalent in grounding.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This however, can be resolved through interaction by adopting appropriate interaction strategies (.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The meaning of words is not grounded just in perception and action but also grounded in particular linguistic interactions or conversations: participants continuously adapt and agree on the meaning of words as apart of their interaction).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This means that having a static model of grounded language which is learned offline from a corpus with a situated robot is not enough but this must be continuously adapted as the interaction unfolds.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The idea of dynamic,

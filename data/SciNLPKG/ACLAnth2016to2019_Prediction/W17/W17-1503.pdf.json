that delimitation of mentions based on their semantic understanding is different for nominal and verbal constructs: for nominal phrases engaged in valency schemata (making the mention 'core') all

to different semantic roles and cannot be linked into a single mention.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This assumption is verified with schemata acquired from Walenty against the PCC gold

undergo syntactic variation (e.g. they have really bitten the bullet this time and her new-found reputation was a bubble that would burst), be lexically varied (e.g. throw/toss in the towel, miss the

processed differently from each other.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The first question plans to determine whether variants are still processed differently from the canonical form when the type of variation is controlled for (e.g. is lexical variation more difficult to comprehend than the original idiom?).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Second, by including several types of variation and controlling for them, a comparison can be made between the different types of variants (e.g. Are there processing differences between, say, lexical variation and partial forms of an

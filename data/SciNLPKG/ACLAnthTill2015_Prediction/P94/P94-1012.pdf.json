For reference, results reported  for English/French generally fall between 96% and  98%. However, all of these numbers should be in- terpreted as highly domain dependent, with very  small sample size.  The above rates are for Type I errors. The  alternative measure of accuracy on Type II er- rors is useful for machine translation applications,  where the objective is to extract only 1-for-1 sen- tence pairs, and to discard all others. In this case,  we are interested in the proportion of 1-for-1 out- put pairs that are true 1-for-1 pairs. (In informa- tion retrieval terminology, this measures precision  whereas the above measures recall.) In the test  session, 438 1-for-1 pairs were output, of which  377, or 86.1%, were true matches.

expression language and of a corresponding fragment of natural language.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The relations between the different components are defined by compositional interpretation and generation functions, and by corresponding combinatory parsers.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This design has been inspired by the logical grammar of Montague.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The grammar-driven design makes it easy to extend and to modify the interface, and also to link it with other functionalities such as compiling and semantic reasoning.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It is also easy to add new languages to the interface.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Both the grammatical theory and the interface facilities based on it have been implemented in the functional programming language Haskell, which supports a declarative and modular style of programming.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Some of the modules developed for the interface have other uses as well: there is a type system of regular expressions, preventing some compiler errors, a denotational semantics in terms of lazy lists, and an extensio~ of the XFST script language by definitions of functions.", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "introductionContent": [{"text": "Regular expressions area mathematical formalism

of occasional and non-programmer users, who might profit from a natural-language interface.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The users of XFST typically write scripts, which are programs consisting of regular expressions mixed with some instructions about what to do with them.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In some cases, an XFST script is accompanied by some informal description of its content.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For instance, the XFST programmer first writes an English text consisting of a sequence of grammatical rules, and then encodes this text rule by rule into the XFST formalism.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The text then remains as a perspicuous and reliable document of the script, particularly useful for those who have not themselves written the program but just use it or want to modify it.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It is partly in the very purpose of making various intuitive ways of expression possible that the rich formalism of XFST has been developed.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, there is no systematic guarantee of the script's being accompanied by a corresponding informal text.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Scripts are often created from scratch, without providing a full document even afterwards.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "And even if a document were written in parallel with the script, the two can differ because of human error.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "They can, of course, also be intentionally different, because the author wants to hide some details of the script.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "But let us take it for granted that it is interesting to have natural language texts exactly corresponding to XFST scripts.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This is at least an interesting theoretical problem, since it requires a very precise grammar of natural languagc zo precise that it would be possible to use natural language as a programming language instead of the formalism of XFST.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Once such a grammar has been given to one language (to a small but sufficient fragment of it, of course), it is relatively easy to do it for other languages as well.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This will immediately lead to the simultaneous multilin~al documentation of XFST scripts.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus we are going to buildup a system with the following functionalities: translating of English and French texts into XFST scripts, translating of XFST scripts into English and French texts, translating between English and French texts (via XFST) so that equivalence of meaning is guaranteed, stepwise editing of XFST scripts, of corresponding English and French texts, and of specialized technical lexica.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We shall argue that the last functionality, stepwise editing, is the most useful one.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It produces more comprehensible results than direct translation, and it encourages a structured style of programming.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Translating from English and French to XFST is probably not useful as such, because it is difficult fora human writer to stay within the recognized fragment.", "labels": [], "entities": [{"text": "XFST", "start_pos": 39, "end_pos": 43, "type": "DATASET", "confidence": 0.6029253005981445}]}, {"text": "But it can be used for checking

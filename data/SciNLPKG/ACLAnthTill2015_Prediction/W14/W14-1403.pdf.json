characterization of computations that produce some kind of side effect (Moggi, 1989), and is based on the notion of mon-ads, a construction in category theory that, intuitively, maps a collection of \"simple\" values and \"simple\" functions into a more complex value space, in a canonical way.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The main advantages of our approach with respect to traditional analyses of opacity are the fact that we are able to explain in a uniform way a set of different but related phenomena, and that we do so in a principled way that has been shown to also

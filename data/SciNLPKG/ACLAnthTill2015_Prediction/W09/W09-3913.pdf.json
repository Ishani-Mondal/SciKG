{"text": "Demonstratives can also be used exophorically without an accompanying ostension, but in such cases the entity referred to is already sufficiently salient in the visual field for the

only difference between the referential capabilities of deictic and anaphoric uses of demonstratives lies in the fact that these capabilities have been transferred from a realworld context of

Again, a  higher proportion of predicates in Liu Yong's writing  seems to suggest a more casual, colloquial style while the  lower proportion of predicates by Su Shi is accompanied by  a relatively higher proportion of objects, thus indicating a  preference for SVO constructions, a feature typically found  in formal prose. Su Shi's more frequent use of adverbials  also seems to confirm this as adverbials have been found to  correlate with degrees of formality albeit reported for  contemporary British writing.

orientation of this research was pursuing an algorithm that generates a minimal description which uniquely identifies a target object from distractors.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus the research was oriented and limited by two constraints: minimality and uniqueness.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The constraint on minimality has, however, been relaxed due to the computational complexity of generation, the perceived naturalness of redundant expressions, and the easiness of understanding them (e.g.,).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "On the other hand, the other constraint of uniqueness has not been paid much attention to.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "One major aim of our research is to relax this constraint on uniqueness because

introduces the concept of parts of objects to deal with more complex domains containing such objects.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Hereby the constraint on uniqueness becomes problematic because people easily generate and understand logically ambiguous expressions in such domains.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For example, people often use an expression such as \"the table with red corners\" to identify table B.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Logically speaking, this expression is equally applicable both to A and to B, that is, violating the constraint on uniqueness.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "And yet people seem to have no problem identifying the intended target correctly and have little reluctance to use such an expression (Evidence is presented in Section 3).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We think that this reflects some type of pragmatic implicature arising from human characteristics of visual perception

student explanations (, because high percentages of selfexplanation and student contentful talk are known to be correlated with better learning in humanhuman tutoring.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, most existing systems use pre-authored tutor responses for addressing student errors.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The advantage of this approach is that tutors can devise remediation dialogues that are highly tailored to specific misconceptions many students share, providing step-by-step scaffolding and potentially suggesting additional problems.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The disadvantage is alack of adaptivity and generality: students often get the same remediation for the same error regardless of their past performance or dialogue context, as it is infeasible to author a different remediation dialogue for every possible dialogue state.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "It also becomes more difficult to experiment with different tutorial policies within the system due to the inherent completixites in applying tutoring strategies consistently across a large number of individual hand-authored remediations.", "labels": [],

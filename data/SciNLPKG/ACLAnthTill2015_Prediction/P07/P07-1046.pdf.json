"With recent advances in spoken dialogue system technologies, researchers have turned their attention to more complex domains (e.g. tutoring (), technical support (, medication assistance ().",

knowledge, and longer system turns.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In typical information access dialogue systems, the task is relatively simple: get the information from the user and return the query results with minimal complexity added by confirmation dialogues.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Moreover, inmost cases, users have knowledge about the task.", "labels":

partially familiar with the tutoring topic.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The length of system turns can also be affected as these systems need to make explicit the connections between parts of the underlying task.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus, interacting with such systems can be characterized by an increased user cognitive load associated with listening to often lengthy system turns and the need to integrate the current information to the discussion overall ().", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We hypothesize that one way to reduce the user's cognitive load is to make explicit two pieces of information: the purpose of the current system turn, and how the system turn relates to the overall discussion.", "labels": [], "entities": []},

is found in every level of granularity of a system.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For instance, in biological systems we find redundancy in the codons, in the genes () and as well in the proteins (.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "A linguistic system is also not an exception.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "There is for example, a number of words with the same meaning (synonyms) in almost every language of the world.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Similarly, the basic unit of language, the human speech sounds or the phonemes, is also expected to exhibit some sort of a redundancy in the information that it encodes.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In this work, we attempt to mathematically capture the redundancy observed across the sound (more specifically the consonant) inventories of the world's languages.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For this purpose, we present an information theoretic definition of redundancy, which is calculated based on the set of features 1 that are used to express the consonants.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "An interesting observation is that this quantitative feature-based measure of redundancy is almost an invariance over the consonant inventories of the world's languages.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The observation is important since it can shed enough light on the organization of the consonant inventories, which unlike the vowel inventories, lack a complete and holistic explanation.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The invariance of our measure implies that every inventory tries to be similar in terms of the measure, which leads us to argue that redundancy plays a very important role in shaping the structure of the consonant inventories.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In order to validate this argument we determine the possibility of observing such an invariance if the consonant inventories had evolved by random chance.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We find that the redundancy observed across the randomly generated inventories is substantially different from their real counterparts, which leads us to conclude that the invariance is not just \"by-chance\" and the measure that we define, indeed, largely governs the organizing principles of the consonant inventories.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Interestingly, this redundancy, when measured for the vowel inventories, does not exhibit any similar invariance.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This immediately reveals that the principles that govern the formation of these two types of inventories are quite different in nature.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Such an observation is significant since whether or not these principles are similar/different for the two inventories had been a question giving rise to perennial debate among the past researchers.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "A possible reason for the observed dichotomy in the behavior of the vowel and consonant inventories with respect to redundancy can be as follows: while the organization of the vowel inventories is known to be governed by a single force -the maximal perceptual contrast), consonant inventories are shaped by a complex interplay of several forces).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The invariance of redundancy, perhaps, reflects some sort of an equilibrium that arises from the interaction of these divergent forces.", "labels": [], "entities": []},

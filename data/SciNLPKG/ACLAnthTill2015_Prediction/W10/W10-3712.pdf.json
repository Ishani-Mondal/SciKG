only provide dictionary look-up of simple words.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, the ability to quickly obtain information about such grammar could not only improve the learner's comprehension of the text, but also facilitate their learning process of new elements of Japanese grammar.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus, we have decided to develop a Japanese reading assistant that is capable of providing explanations of functional expressions in addition to vocabulary.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Functional expressions in Japanese are

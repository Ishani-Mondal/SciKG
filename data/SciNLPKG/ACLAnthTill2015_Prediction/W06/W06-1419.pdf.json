experts.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Although we usually carryout a domain/corpus/task analysis beforehand to acquire the domain knowledge and understand the users' needs in terms of the text to be generated, it is almost impossible to become a domain expert and know what is the most appropriate in each situation.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus, the design of a specific application should allow the experts to take on control and ensure the application is configured appropriately.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This imposes the additional

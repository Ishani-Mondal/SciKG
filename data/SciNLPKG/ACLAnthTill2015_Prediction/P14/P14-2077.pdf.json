We can see that our  ECTM_MB outperform other methods. The  ECTM_MB can identify correct task names  within the first three recommendations. Unsur- prisingly, Cluster_Q_RS achieved worst inclu- sion rate. The reason is that Cluster _Q_RS try to  find comprehensive complex task name based on  search results from only a single query. Most of  task names suggested by Cluster_Q_RS are sim- ple task names i.e., the sub-tasks for the latent  complex task, such as \"\u9810\u8a02\u6a5f\u7968(book flight  tickets)\". For ECTM_RS, which is a variation of  Cluster_EQ_RS, it achieved slightly better per- formance by adding the restrictions of POS pat- terns for extracting candidate task names. Since  some identified task names in Cluster_EQ_RS  may not semantically suitable, ECTM_RS's ap- proach can efficiently deal with this problem.  Furthermore, we also found that using search- result snippets may generate worse task names  than using microblog posts. According to our  investigating on the two types of the short-text- snippet resources, the search-result snippets are  very diverse and task-extrinsic while microblog  posts are task-coherent in describing real-life  tasks.", "labels": [], "entities": [{"text": "inclu- sion rate", "start_pos": 197, "end_pos": 213, "type": "METRIC", "confidence": 0.9198547601699829}]}, {"text": " Table 4.

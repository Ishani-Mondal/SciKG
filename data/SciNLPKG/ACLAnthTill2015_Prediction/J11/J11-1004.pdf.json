real-time tasks.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For instance, a driver in a car might use a speech interface to catch upon e-mails, while occasionally checking upcoming traffic conditions,

{"text": "Several speech interfaces that allow multi-tasking dialogues have been built (e.g.,.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, it is unclear that the mechanisms of managing

dialogues.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Given the scenario where a real-time task with a time constraint arises during the course of an ongoing task, we are specially interested in two switching behaviors: task interruption, which is to suspend the ongoing task and switch to a waiting real-time task, and task resumption, which is to return to the interrupted ongoing task after completing a realtime task.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The first question we ask is how quickly conversants respond to a real-time task.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text":

turn.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, if the real-time task is less urgent, for example, the driver does not like the music and wants the passenger to load another CD, do

vary the intensity of the cues, and under what circumstances.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The third question we ask is what conversants do immediately upon resuming the ongoing task.",

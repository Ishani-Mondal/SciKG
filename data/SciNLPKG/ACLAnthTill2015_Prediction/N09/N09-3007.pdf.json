Inter- estingly, top-ranked features are all contextual ones.  In fact, in later models where the ranks of mor- phological features are boosted, the algorithm per- formed worse as a result of relying too much on  those context-insensitive features.  Collectively, top-ranked features define the con- textual patterns of event nouns. We are interested  in finding semantic subcategories within the set of  event nouns (497 nouns, Trial 2) by exploiting these  features individually. For instance, some events typ- ically happen to people only (e.g. birth, betrayal),  while others usually happen to inanimate objects  (e.g. destruction, removal).

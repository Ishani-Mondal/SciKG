the interaction of sound change with the phonemic system (poten-tially promoting certain changes, but also neutralizing phonemic distinctions); and the detection of these phenomena in historical documents.", "labels": [], "entities": [{"text": "lexical diffusion)", "start_pos": 231, "end_pos": 249, "type": "TASK", "confidence": 0.8282016317049662}]}, {"text": "There is a substantial and growing body of work applying computational techniques of various sorts to problems in historical phonology.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We mention a few hereto give the flavor of the sort of work we hoped to attract for presentation in a coherent SIG-MORPHON workshop.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Kessler (2001) estimates the likelihood of chance phonemic correspondences using permutation statistics;

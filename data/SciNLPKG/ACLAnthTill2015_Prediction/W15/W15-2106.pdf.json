adverbial derivatives refer to the same situation as the source lexical unit (LU).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This implies that, given the semantic structure with predicate P, our linguistic description should be able to produce a syntactic structure in which P is realized by means of an adverbial derivative of P and determine possible syntactic positions for LUs that correspond to semantic actants of P.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "And, the other way round, given sentences such as John replied by a nod and John nodded in reply, we should be able to

of adverbial derivatives in their correlation with the source LU.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For each predicate, we need to know its possible syntactic realizations (e.g. 'reply' --> to reply -in reply) along with semantic modifications associated with them.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For each syntactic realization, we should specify possible ways of valency filling of the LU.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The main difference between this approach and traditional valency dictionaries is that we concentrate on adverbial derivatives of

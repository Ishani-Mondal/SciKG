restructuring encyclopedic resources (like Wikipedia or thesauri) to reorder concepts with the goal of helping learners navigate through a concept network without getting trapped in circular dependencies between concepts.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We present approaches that can help content authors identify regions in the concept network, that after editing, would have maximal impact in terms of enhancing the utility of the resource to learners.", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "introductionContent": [{"text": "The digital age opens up the possibility of using a mix of online resources for self-study.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Not all of these resources have rich pedagogical content, tailored to suit the user's learning goals.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Therefore, while greedily looking out for pages of interest, a learner often finds a stopgap solution using a resource like Wikipedia, but may need to put in substantial effort to stitch together a set of content pages to address her learning needs.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In this paper, we distinguish between two kinds of resources: encyclopedic and pedagogic.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Encyclopedic resources like Wikipedia or thesauri have good reference value and broad coverage, but are not necessarily structured with the goal of assisting learning of concepts.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "An online textbook, in contrast, is a pedagogic resource in that it has its content organized to realize specific tutoring goals.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, textbooks in their current form have definite limitations.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Firstly, the content is often not dynamic, and does not adapt to learner requirements.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Second, unlike Wikipedia, textbooks are often not collaboratively authored, some are expensive, and many subjects have no structured learning resources at all.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This paper is motivated by the central question -\"How can we effectively create a pedagogic view of content from encyclopedic resources?\"", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "At the current state of the art, it would be ambitious to conceive of fully automated solutions to this question.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The more pragmatic goal would be to examine the extent to which tools can be devised that can effectively aid humans in (a) constructing such views (b) facilitating the learner in navigating through such views.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "For the purpose of analysis, we present an abstraction of an encyclopedic resource in the form of a concept network, and show how graph theoretic approaches can be used to restructure such a network with the goal of making it pedagogically useful.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "While the formal development of this idea is detailed in Section 2, the central idea is as follows.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Consider a concept network constructed using Wikipedia articles as concept nodes and hyperlinks as directed edges.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Since Wikipedia articles are authored independently, it is not unusual that the author of an article A assumes that a concept B is known when the reader is on the Wikipedia page of A, while the author of concept B assumes exactly the opposite.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "This results in a circular definition of concepts, thus making the learner flip back and forth between these articles.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "A pedagogical resource overcomes this bottleneck by ensuring that the corresponding concept network is a directed acyclic graph.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "A textbook, for example, structures concepts in away that ensures that no concept is used before being defined () (an exception is the set of concepts that the textbook assumes the learner is already familiar with).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus, a well written textbook, together with a set of such prerequisites, ensures that the concept network is cycle-free.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "If experts were to analyse Wikipedia content to create pedagogic views on specific subjects, they would benefit from tools that can potentially make best use of their time and effort, by identifying regions in the network that need expert attention.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "In the context of this paper, we use a dictionary of words as an example of an encyclopedic resource, where a word is treated as a concept, and an edge exists from a concept to the concept whose definition mentions it.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Using a dictionary as opposed to Wikipedia simplifies the discussion and allows us to read into our empirical findings more readily.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Though not much is sacrificed in terms of generality, we identify issues in scaling the idea to Wikipedia.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "We also note that the emphasis of the current paper is largely on the problem of creating views, and not on presenting the views to the end user (learner).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Thus we envisage that the current paper is a first in a line of research aimed at creating tools that complement both content creators and learners in creating and using pedagogical resources crafted from diverse starting points.", "labels": [], "entities": []}], "datasetContent": [{"text": "In our experiments, we have used standard corpora Brown and

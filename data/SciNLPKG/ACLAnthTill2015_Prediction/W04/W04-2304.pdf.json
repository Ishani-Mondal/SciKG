goal of the NICE project is to allow users of all ages to interact with lifelike conversational characters in a fairy-tale world inspired by the Danish author H C Andersen.", "labels": [], "entities":

world.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "What primarily distinguishes the NICE fairy-tale game system from other spoken dialogue systems is that the human-computer dialogue takes place within the context of an interactive computer game.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However, spoken and multimodal dialogue is not supposed to be just an 'add-on' to the game, but the user's primary means of progression through the story.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The rationale for this is the great potential for more natural interaction we see in making methods from multimodal dialogue systems available in controlling gameplay.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Potentially, spoken and multimodal interaction will make it possible to create a more engaging

systems is the attempt to move away from strictly task-oriented dialogue.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Instead, the interaction with the characters is domain-oriented.", "labels": [],

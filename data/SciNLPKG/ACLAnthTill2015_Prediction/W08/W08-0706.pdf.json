of accentual stress, and finds that among a sample of 306 languages with quantity-insensitive (QI) stress systems, 26 distinct stress patterns are found, 1 while over 60% of the languages surveyed use one of just 3 of these patterns.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "If we begin to look at morphosyntactic or semantic properties, the combinatorics of possible systems veritably explodes,

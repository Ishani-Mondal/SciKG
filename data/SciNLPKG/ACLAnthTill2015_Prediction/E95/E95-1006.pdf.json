"Unlike most linguistic theories, LFG (see) treats grammatical relations as first class citizens.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Accordingly, it casts its linguistic analyses in terms of a

constraining manner.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "As has been amply demonstrated over the last fifteen years, this view permits perspicuous analyses of a wide variety of linguistic data.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "However standard formalisations of LFG do not capture its strikingly simple underlying intuitions.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Instead,

our ultimate goal: providing a specification language for LFG grammars.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Actually, with the ontological issues settled it is a relatively simple task to

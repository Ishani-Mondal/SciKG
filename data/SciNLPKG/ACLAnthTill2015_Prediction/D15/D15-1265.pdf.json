"entities": []}, {"text": "Firstly, at least two speakers are engaged in a dialogue session, while the texts in newswire or microblogs are mostly written by a single author.", "labels": [],

correspondence between mentions and concepts in spoken dialogues tends to be dependent not only on the contexts explicitly mentioned in a given dialogue, but also on other information inferred by speakers based on their background knowledge.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The other difference is that spoken utterances are more likely to be informal and noisy than written sentences, which makes expressions more ambiguous and variable.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "To solve these issues, we propose a three step approach for Wikification on spoken dialogues.",

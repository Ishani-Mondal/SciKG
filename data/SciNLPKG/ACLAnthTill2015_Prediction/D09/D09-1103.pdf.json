This suggests the usefulness of the rela- tive pronominal ranking feature in resolving  pronominal anaphors over longer distance. This  is consistent with our observation that, as the  percentage of pronominal anaphors referring to  more distant antecedents increase, its impact  turns gradually from negative to positive, when  further including the relative pronominal ranking  feature after the semantic role features. The rea- son that we include the detailed pronominal sub- category information is due to predominant  importance of pronouns in tracking the local  focus structure in discourse and that such de- tailed pronominal subcategory information is  discriminative in tracking different subcatego- ries of pronouns. This suggests the usefulness of  considering the distribution of the local dis- course focus over detailed pronominal subcate- gories. One interesting finding in our  preliminary experimentation is that the inclusion  of the detailed pronominal subcategory features  alone even harms the performance. This may be  due to the reason that the detailed pronominal  subcategory features do not have the discrimina- tive power themselves and that the semantic role  features and the relative pronominal ranking fea- ture provide an effective mechanism to explore  the role of such detailed pronominal subcategory  features in helping determine the local discourse  focus.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": " Table 8: Performance comparison of pronoun resolu- tion in F-measure over pronoun subcategories", "labels": [], "entities": [{"text": "F-measure", "start_pos": 60, "end_pos": 69, "type": "METRIC", "confidence": 0.8679595589637756}]}, {"text": " Table 9: Performance comparison of pronoun resolu- tion in F-measure over sentence distances", "labels": [], "entities": [{"text": "F-measure", "start_pos": 60, "end_pos": 69, "type": "METRIC", "confidence": 0.8435606360435486}]}]}

We used the Precision/Recall/F 1 metrics  introduced by Marcu (2000). The ablation test removes  various feature groups: features extracted from the de- pendency representation (dep), features from constituent  syntax (const), and coreference features (coref). We com- pare against previous work that reported end-to-end per- formance of their corresponding approaches (Hernault et  al., 2010; Joty et al., 2013; Joty and Moschitti, 2014).", "labels": [], "entities": []}]}
